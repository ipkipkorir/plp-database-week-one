                    <strong>Database:</strong>
                    An organized group of data that can be accessed, retrieved, modified or updated.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Table:</strong>
                    A component of database that keeps related data in the form of rows and columns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Record:</strong>
                    Refers to a row of data in a table in the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Field:</strong>
                    Refers to a column of data in a table in the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Primary key:</strong>
                    This a field or column in a table that uniquely identifies a record(row) in a table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>SQL:</strong>
                    It stands for Structured Query Language. This is a language used for creating, retrieving, updating and deleting data in
                    a database. It is also used managing controls and defining data in the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Query:</strong>

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Index:</strong>
                    Index is a pointer to specific data in a database. It helps to speed the process of searching the database for specific
                    data or information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Normalization:</strong>
                    This is the process of removing data redundancy during database design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Database Management System (DBMS):</strong>
                    This is a software with a graphical user interface that helps users in performing database functions such as creating
                    databases, tables, etc.

                    <strong>The purpose of primary key:</strong>
                    Primary key ensures that every record in a table is uniquely identified such that there are no two records in a table
                    having identical or the same primary key. For example, the records of transactions in a retail shop will have primary
                    keys to help identify each transaction separately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Difference between <em>DBMS</em> and <em>database:</em></strong>
                    DBMS is an application software that helps the user to consume the services of a database with ease. usually, a DBMS has
                    a graphical user interface. Examples of commonly used DBMSs include MySql and Postgres.</br>
                    Database is the logical organization of data for ease of access, manipulation and retrieval of the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Importance of Normalization:</strong>
                    Normalization helps to organize data into small entities that are related but have no repetition of the same data. This
                    improves data integrity.
